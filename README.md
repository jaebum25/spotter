## Patch v1 Notes

This is the initial launch of Spotter.

A microblogging service app that uses Deezer API to search through your favorite artist's discography.

## Background info:

This is a project I started for a Software Engineering bootcamp @GeneralAssembly.
Spotter is inspired by Twitter and Spotify.
In dedication to my search for new music, I hope you are able to explore and enjoy.
